This is a recreation of the game Isolation.
The nordic version is called Isola and was the version I played as a kid.

Get the image link to work :sob:.


## What is Isola?
Isolation was created in the 1970's by a company named [Lakeside][Lside].
The version I played called [Isola][Isola] was released 1972 by the company 
[Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH][GmbH].

### Rules
---ToDo---

Add rules

### My modifications
I decided to recreate the game with the option to play against more players than one. 
Have in mind that this game is designed to be played by only two persons so the addition of more players 
will probably result in one of your friends (or you) getting bullied, sorry!

---ToDo---

Write about all modifications

## How to run
Navigate to the ```run.sh``` script and run it with the command ```./run.sh```.
This will compile the project to ```.Class``` files and execute the file.

---ToDo---

Update to .jar file
